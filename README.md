Julia scripts associated with "A White Noise Approach to Evolutionary Ecology" by [Week et. al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110660) for simulating individual-based models, approximating their diffusion limits, solving associated SPDE and solving SDE corresponding to an eco-evolutionary model of a competitive community.
